folder contains 
main.c,  prompts.c and prompts.h, and a make file for compilation
on linux  should work on linux subsystem for linux (ubuntu 20.4) 

while this assignment didn't require seperation of the program into seperate files 
i thought it would be best to practice making a make file 

make has an ancompanying make clean command to clear *.o files
